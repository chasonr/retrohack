Well, here they are, the sources of Hack for pdp11/44 and pdp11/45.

How to install these on your machine.
This is actually quite simple. Edit the file ``envir.h'' to define the
local parameters. Edit the Makefile to define the playdir directory
(default /usr/games). Determine who will be the owner of the game, since
it has the setuid bits on. 
After you unshared the shar-files (in a new directory),
you should have the following files:
	1) - help data Makefile show.c rnd.c alloc.c

	2) - envir.h hack.armors.h hack.do.vars.h hack.dog.h hack.foods.h 
	   - hack.h hack.name.h hack.vars.h hack.weapons.h 

	3) - hack.bones.c hack.c hack.debug.c hack.do.c hack.do.misc.c 
	   - hack.do1.c hack.do_wear.c hack.dog.c hack.eat.c hack.end.c 
	   - hack.invent.c hack.invinit.c hack.io.c hack.lev.c hack.main.c 
	   - hack.mkobj.c hack.mon.c hack.mon.do.c hack.monst.c hack.move.c 
	   - hack.office.c hack.pri.c hack.rip.c hack.save.c hack.savelev.c 
	   - hack.shk.c hack.str.c hack.worm.c

	4) - mklev.c mklev.make.c mklev.mkobj.c mklev.svlev.c 

Now type ``make'' and the file ``hack'', ``mklev'' and ``show'' will be created.
Now type make new and the program will be installed in the right place.

One of the main problems of Hack is its size. If you add about 1000 bytes of
text more, your text segment will be to big. Therefore we saved text wherever 
this was possible. We removed the function fscanf(), and made the record file
binary. To show the contents, use the program show (with flag -r).

Some additions we (Fred de Wilde and Michiel Huisjes) made are
	- The Vault
	- The Swamp
	- The Zoo
	- The Graveyard
	- Maxlevel = 40
	- Proper Saving
	- Several bugs
	- And many, many more...
A great bug that still exists is the display of the screen when you're blind.
Some more bugs are still existing, but you'll find those out while playing.

There is not a manual included with these sources. I suggest you use the
manual of the distributed version of hack (1.0.1) of CWI. 

Have fun, and good hacking!
